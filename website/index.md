# Connectivity Working Group (WG1)

This is the homepage of the [Connectivity Working Group (WG1)](https://github.com/carbon-data-specification/Connectivity),
part of the
[Carbon Data Specification Consortium (CDSC)](https://www.lfenergy.org/projects/carbon-data-specification-cds/),
an [LF Energy](https://www.lfenergy.org/) project.

## Scope <a id="scope" href="#scope" class="permalink">🔗</a>

This repository is dedicated to the Connectivity Working Group. We focus on writing free, open specifications for
utilities and other central entities to provide discovery, registration, connectivity, and profile management
abilities to third party entities.

## Use Cases <a id="use-cases" href="#use-cases" class="permalink">🔗</a>

We have defined several broad categories of [use cases]({{ "/use-cases" | relative_url }}) we will focus on addressing with our specifications.

* Coming soon! See [Issue #1](https://github.com/carbon-data-specification/Connectivity/issues/1) for our progress on finalizing our use cases.

We've also made a list of what data and functionality is specifically [not in scope]({{ "/use-cases" | relative_url }}#not-in-scope).

## Specifications <a id="specs" href="#specs" class="permalink">🔗</a>

These are the official [specifications]({{ "/specs" | relative_url }}) written by this working group.

{% include spec_list.md %}
